### Admin Notice After Updates / Invalid Block

When you update the plugin, editors may see an admin banner explaining that Gutenberg could show an “Attempt Block Recovery” prompt when editing older posts with PDFs. Clicking it updates the block format; it does not affect what visitors see. You can dismiss the banner, and it won’t reappear until a future release enables it again.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed either directly from your WordPress admin panel by searching for **PDF.js Viewer**, or downloading from the Wordpress Plugin Repository and uploading and expanding the archive into your sites `wp-content/plugins` directory.
